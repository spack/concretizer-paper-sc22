  HPC and AI software has become extremely complex. Software packages make use of many
  programming models and libraries to exploit a growing variety of available GPUs and
  other accelerators. Package managers can mitigate this complexity, but integrating a
  coherent software stack has never been harder. Simply finding compatible dependency
  {\it versions} NP-complete, and with build-time options, multiple GPUs, flags, and
  other parameters, the configuration space is enormous. Simply {\it modeling}
  compatibility semantics to choose a ``good'' configuration is daunting.

  We tackle this complexity using Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative model for
  combinatorial search problems. We integrate an ASP solver into the popular {\it Spack}
  package manager, and we show how it allows us to concisely model ever-growing
  complexities of HPC software, while seamlessly mixing source builds with optimized
  binaries. We show good performance on repositories with tens of thousands of package
  builds.
