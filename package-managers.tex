\section{Package Managers}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{sec:pack-managers}

The idea of ``sofware release management'' for large numbers of independent packages dates back to a 1997 paper from Ven der Hoek et al.~\cite{van1997software}, and the first package managers for Linux distributions emerged around the same time~\cite{rpm,apt}. Early package managers managed a single-prefix installation of hand-curated packages.

\subsection{Single-prefix Package Managers}

System package managers such as RPM, Yum, and APT~\cite{foster+:rpm03,silva:apt01,yum} are integrated with most OS distributions, and are used to ensure system software dependencies are installed along with system software.
These tools focus on managing a single softare stack, built with a single compiler, which works well for system software and drivers, which must be common across all software on the system.
They allow only one version of a package and install everything to a known common location.

Portage systems such as Gentoo, BSD Ports, Macports, and Homebrew typically operate in a similar solving space to the binary system package managers previously discussed, although they differ by building packages from source.
Some portage systems allow multiple versions of a package to be installed simultaneously~\cite{groffen:gentoo-prefix}, but the burden is on the package creator to manage conflicts.
In practice, this leads to systems that manage a very small subset of possible configurations, prioritizing correctness of known configurations over exploration of the configuration space.

Even this limited space of softare management, the version selection problem, was proven to be NP-complete by Di Cosmo et al.~\cite{dicosmo:edos,mancinelli+:ase06-foss-distros}.
Early work on solving the version selection problem with SAT solvers led to the Mancoosi project, which focused on a modular package manager with interchangeable solvers~\cite{abate2012dependency,abate-2013-modular-package-manager}.
The Mancoosi project published the Common Upgradeability Description Format (CUDF) as an attempt to standardize the interface between package managers and solvers.

CUDF allowed package managers to experiment with new solver implementations.
CUDF solvers have used Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, Boolean Optimization, and Answer Set Programming~\cite{michel+:lococo2010,argelich+:lococo2010,gebser+:2011-aspcud}.
Many modern linux distributions use CUDF-like formats to express upgrade scenarios to the solver~\cite{abate2020dependency}.

\subsection{Language Package Managers}

Although the earliest package managers evolved for Linux distributions, modern language implementations often include their own package managers~\cite{npm,pip,cargo,weizenbaum:pubgrub18}.
The solver requirements for language package managers are different from those in a linux distribution; they typically allow multiple versions of the same package to be installed to match the workflows of the developers who typically use them.
However, these language package managers still typically solve only for package names and versions, ignoring other factors like compilers and build options that could round out the solution space.

Many language package managers do not use complete solvers.
Solvers are complicated software that is difficult to use, and most programmers are not familiar with solvers and their capabilities.
Additionally, most language maintainers prefer to write package managers and other community software in the languages they maintain --- since fast, effective solvers are typically written in well-established, compiled languages, modern and interpreted language communities see the solver as an unwanted external dependency for their package manager.

More recently, some language package managers have determined that they need complete solvers for their communities. The Pip package manager for Python, for example, recently adopted a new algorithm to resolve dependencies using a solver~\cite{pip-new-resolver}, and the maintainers of the Dart package manager wrote a custom CDCL SAT solver called PubGrup~\cite{weizenbaum:pubgrub18}.
Other package managers are moving in this direction as well; the Cargo~\cite{cargo} package manager for Rust is moving towards using PubGrub as well~\cite{pubgrub-rs} by reimplementing the algorithm in Rust.

\subsection{Functional Package Managers and HPC Package Managers}

``Functional'' package managers like Nix~\cite{dolstra+:icfp08,dolstra+:lisa04} and Guix~\cite{courtes-guix-2015} allow users to install arbitrarily many configurations of a given package.
Like many HPC facilities deployments, they install each configuration to a unique location, but they do not provide human-readable paths for each installation.
They ensure uniqueness of the prefix by using a hash of the configuration for its install path.

Functional package managers have not adopted solvers for resolving dependencies, although the space of configurations over which they find resolutions is much larger than that of a single-prefix package manager.
Their implementation in functional languages and their functional structure require users to create functions for individual configurations.
Whether because of the unpopularity of functional languages or their lack of a complete solver, functional package managers have not caught on in the HPC space, despite their ability to offer coinstallation.
A major motivation of \spack was to merge the ease of use of a Portage system with the flexibility displayed by the functional package managers.

Another common package manager in the HPC space is Easybuild~\cite{hoste+:pyhpc12}.
Like \spack and like the functional package managers, it allows multiple configurations of a package to be installed at once.
Like the functional package managers, and unlike \spack, Easybuild has opted to couple dependency resolution tightly with user-provided known configurations.
This has made Easybuild particularly popular in facility deployments at large supercomputing centers, where facility staff have traditionally maintained the known-good configurations, and can input that knowleadge to Easybuild.
