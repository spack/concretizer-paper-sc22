\label{sec:software-model}

\spack~\cite{gamblin+:sc15} is a package manager designed to support High Performance
Computing (HPC). Like functional package managers, \spack installs packages in separate
prefixes to allow arbitrarily many installations to coexist. This enables users to build
many different variants of a package, e.g., with different compilers, different MPI
implementations, different flags, or with combinations of all three of these parameters.
This greatly expands the space of possible build configurations.

At a high level, \spack can be broken down into three primary components. The {\it spec
  syntax} allows users to easily specify and constrain builds on the command line. The
{\it package domain-specific language (DSL)} expresses parameterized build recipes for
software packages, and the {\it concretizer} is Spack's dependency solver. The
concretizer combines {\it abstract} (i.e., underspecified) spec constraints from the
user and from packages, and it produces a {\it concrete}, or fully specified package
spec that can be installed. We provide an overview of these pieces here but full details
are in the original paper~\cite{gamblin+:sc15}.

\subsection{Spec Syntax}
\label{sec:specs}

Spack calls its internal dependency graphs ``specs'' because they specify parameters of
a software installation along with those of its dependencies. Specs are directed acyclic
graphs where nodes are packages and edges are dependency relationsihps. The ``spec
syntax'' is a shorthand for expressing constraints on these graphs. Each node of the
graph has parameters, including:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the package name;
\item the version to build;
\item variants (compile-time build options);
\item the compiler to build with and its version;
\item compiler flags;
\item the target operating system;
\item the target microarchitecture; and
\item the package installation's dependencies.
\end{enumerate}

\input{sigil-tab}

The spec syntax in \spack allows users to specify preferences within this combinatorial
build space. In the simplest case, a user might want to build a particular package {\it
  without} any concern for its configuration. In this case they would write:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,bgcolor=bg]{text}
spack install hdf5
\end{minted}
Spack will install {\tt hdf5} without any particular customization.
Table~\ref{tab:sigil} shows examples of {\it sigils} that can be used to specify
specific constraints on specs, including any of the attributes listed above. The spec
syntax is fully recursive, in that users can specify constraints on dependencies using
the {\tt \^{}} (``depends on'') sigil. For example, the spec below:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,bgcolor=bg]{text}
hdf5@1.10.2 ^zlib%gcc ^cmake target=aarch64
\end{minted}

means ``any possible build of the package \texttt{hdf5} at version {\tt 1.10.2} that
depends on a build of the package \texttt{zlib} built with the \texttt{gcc} compiler and
a build of the package \texttt{cmake} built to target the \texttt{aarch64}
architecture''. While users could completely constrain a build via the spec syntax, in
practice they only care about a comparatively small set of constraints, and they rely on
concretization to select values for unspecified parameters. We refer to a portion of the
build space in \spack as an ``abstract spec'', and a fully specified build as a
``concrete spec''.

\subsection{Package DSL}
\label{sec:package-dsl}

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}[linenos,numbersep=-5pt,fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
  # This is the classname for the package `example`
  class Example(Package):
      '''An example package that depends on zlib, mpi
      and optionally bzip2 for compression.'''

      version("1.1.0")
      version("1.0.0")

      variant("bzip", default=True,
              description="use bzip enhanced compression")

      # Depends on bzip2 or later for enhanced compression
      depends_on("bzip2@1.0.7:", when="+bzip")
      depends_on("zlib")  # depends on zlib
      # Newer versions require newer versions of zlib
      depends_on("zlib@1.2.8:", when="@1.1.0:")

      # Depends on *some* MPI implementation
      depends_on("mpi")

      # Known failure when building with intel compilers
      conflicts("%intel")
      # Does not support architectures derived from ARM64
      conflicts("target=aarch64:")

      def install(self, spec, prefix):
          # Translate spec into arguments to build system
          config_args = ['--with-zlib=%s' % spec[zlib'].prefix]

          if 'bzip2' in spec:
              bz_arg = '--with-bzip=%s' % spec[bzip2'].prefix
          else:
              bz_arg = '--without-bzip'
          config_args.append(bz_arg)

          # Run the build system --
          # configure and make methods automatically generated
          configure(*config_args)
          make()
          make('install')
\end{minted}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:example-spack-package} shows Spack's package DSL. Unlike many systems, a
package in \spack is a {\it parameterized} Python class. There is {\it one} package
recipe for each package, and it is {\it instantiated} for each concrete spec that Spack
builds. The {\tt install()} function on line 26 takes a fully concrete spec as one of
its parameters, and its job is to install {\it that} particular configuration of the
{\tt example} package into the specified {\tt prefix}.

The install instructions on lines 26-40 do the work of the build, but more interesting
for this paper are the metadata directives on lines 6-24. This package has two possible
versions, {\tt 1.0.0} and {\tt 1.1.0}. It has one build option, or ``variant'', called
{\tt bzip} that enables the dependency on {\tt bzip2}. Its dependency on {\tt zlib} is
dependent on its version. Conditions like these are specified using {\tt when} clauses
within directives. It has some {\tt conflicts} for which it is known not to build
successfully. Dependency constraints, conflicts, and {\tt when} clauses are all
specified concisely using the  spec syntax.
%
The dependency on {\tt mpi} on line 19 is special. Spack provides support for packages
that are source-compatible (API-compatible), like MPI. There is no concrete {\tt mpi}
package in Spack, rather there are several {\tt mpi} {\it providers}, like {\tt mpich},
{\tt openmpi}, etc. This package can be instantiated with {\it any} of these MPI
providers. We thus call {\tt mpi} a``virtual dependency''. {\tt blas} and {\tt lapack}
are two other common examples in HPC.

\subsection{Concretization}

Spack can build the {\tt example} package in Figure~\ref{fig:example-spack-package} in
{\it many} different ways. The metadata in the package DSL exposes a combinatorial build
configuration space, and it is the {\it concretizer}'s job to select a configuration
from this space. The {\it concretizater} is Spack's dependency solver, so called because
it converts partially constrained \emph{abstract specs} to fully constrained
\emph{concrete specs} that can be built when combined with the installation methods in
the package DSL.

There are three primary inputs to concretization in \spack: specs on the command line,
constraints from the package DSL, and additional preferences from user configuration
files. Without loss of generality, we will consider only the first two here; user
configuration adds additional optimization criteria to the solve.
%
%The
%user configuration allows the user to change the default behaviors of \spack, but is not
%necessary to understand the workings of the concretizer. In the following discussion of
%the concretizer, in many places the algorithm will ``choose the default'' or ``choose
%the most preferred ...'' when otherwise unconstrained. In all of those cases, \spack has
%builtin defaults that can be overriden with user configuration.
%
%For each virtual
%dependency, even more options arise to complicate the build space as an implementation
%must be selected in addition to all of the decisions necessasary to build that
%implementation.
%
On a conceptual level, we can think of the concretizer as accomplishing two tasks.
First, it determines the set of packages needed in the spec DAG. Second, it fills in any
missing nodal parameters (enumerated in Section~\ref{sec:specs}). Every decision made by
the concretizer must consider constraints from all the input sources; any unsatisifed
constraints imply an {\it invalid} solution. We say a solution is {\it valid} if and only if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item all virtuals are replaced with concrete dependencies;
\item all dependencies are resolved;
\item all node parameters have been assigned values; and
\item all input constraints are satisfied.
\end{enumerate}

Consider our package \texttt{example} from Section~\ref{sec:package-dsl}, we will
concretize the abstract spec:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,bgcolor=bg]{text}
example@1.0.0 ^zlib@1.2.11
\end{minted}
We will assume for the moment that neither \texttt{zlib} nor \texttt{bzip2} have any
additional dependencies. Then the set of packages and constraints needed for this
abstract spec is

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt example@1.0.0} constraint from the abstract spec
\item {\tt bzip2@1.0.7:} constraint from example package file
\item {\tt zlib@1.2.11} constraint from abstract spec
\item {\tt mpich} concrete replacement for virtual dependency
\end{itemize}

The original concretizer would simply proceed until all decisions had been made,
stopping at the first conflict it found with any prior decision. If it completed, the
resulting concrete spec might look like:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,bgcolor=bg]{text}
example@1.0.0+bzip%gcc@11.2.0 arch=linux-centos8-skylake
  ^bzip2@1.0.8+pic%gcc@11.2.0 arch=linux-centos8-skylake
  ^zlib@1.2.11+pic%gcc@11.2.0 arch=linux-centos8-skylake
  ^mpich@3.1 pmi=pmix %gcc@11.2.0 arch=linux-centos8-skylake
\end{minted}

Here, all dependencies are expanded, all node parameters (variants, compilers, targets,
etc.) have been bassigned and no constraints are violated. None of these nodes are fully
concrete, so additional decisions must be made from preferences. We will consider only
\texttt{example} since we have its package file, but the same process would apply to
\texttt{zlib}, \texttt{bzip2}, and \texttt{mpich}. The original Spack concretizer used a
greedy, fixed-point algorithm. The issue with this algorithm (and all greedy algorithms)
is that it only made {\it local} decisions about dependencies and node parameters, and
it could not backtrack to undo decisions that it made. So, for example, the original
concretizer might choose version 1.0.7 for {\tt bzip2} here, but if the {\tt mpich}
package {\it conflicts} with {\tt bzip2@:1.0.7:} (versions of {\tt bzip} up to and
including 1.0.7), then concretization may fail even though {\tt 1.0.8} would have
worked. The solve is thus {\it incomplete}. Similarly, because the original concretizer
would only make local optimization decisions, it made no global guarantees of
optimality.

%For \texttt{example}, the version is already fully constrained. Barring user
%configuration, the default compiler in \spack is the newest version of \texttt{gcc}
%available on the system, so the concretizer may choose \texttt{gcc@11.2.0}. For
%architecture options, the default is the current architecture. We will assume the
%algorithm is running on a linux system running \texttt{centos8} on a \texttt{skylake}
%CPU. Our package file for \texttt{example} specifies the default value for the variant
%\texttt{bzip} is True, so the concretizer chooses that value in the absence of user
%configuration to the contrary. This creates a feedback loop with the list of nodes,
%increasing the complexity of the algorithm. The concrete spec generated would be:

In addition to these issues, the original concretizer was implemented directly on the
dependency graph structure in memory. Any new semantics had to be implemented with
complex graph algorithms, and graph nodes and edges had to be configured and updated
manually. This process was error-prone and limited the speed of development and the
complexity of the semanics that could be considered.
