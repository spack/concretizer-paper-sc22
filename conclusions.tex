The complexity of software dependencies and optimization needs in HPC creaates a particular challenge for package management in the HPC space.
Ad-hoc techniques for dependency resolution have proven to require substantial investment of programmer hours to manage even a small subset of the possible space of HPC software configurations.

In this paper we introduced a new dependency resolution method for \spack{}, an HPC package manager.
This new dependency resolution method uses Answer Set Programming to create general mapping of Spack's DSL, compatibility semantics, and optimization rules in a maintainable, declarative syntax.
It has also allowed us to implement new functionality for \spack{}, such as targeted reuse of existing installations and binary packages, that was simply infeasible with previous methods reliant on a greedy fixed-point algorithm.

We also showed the performance of the new concretization algorithm is competitive in most cases with the previous algorithm.
Performance of the reuse capablity scaled to tens of thousands of potentially reusable binary packages.

The improvements we introduced in this paper are not merely theoretical --- they are seeing worldwide use in production through the most recent major version release of \spack{}.
